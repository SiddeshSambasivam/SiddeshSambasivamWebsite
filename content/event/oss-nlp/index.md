summary: In this workshop, we cover fundamentals of NLP such as word embeddings, probabilistic and neural language models. We'll cover all the theory behind these topics and finally, build a simple language model to get some hands-on experience.

abstract: Natural language processing is a rich domain in the field of deep learning concerning the interaction between computers and human language.  It is one of the most broadly applied areas of deep learning with applications such as question-answering, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and chatbots.  <br/><br/> In this workshop, we cover fundamentals of NLP such as word embeddings, probabilistic and neural language models. We'll cover all the theory behind these topics and finally, build a simple language model to get some hands-on experience. Understanding these foundational concepts will help you to learn about more advanced topics such as sequence and attention models.<br/><br/>
