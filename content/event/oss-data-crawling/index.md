summary: Attendees will learn about the entire data preparation and collection stage in a machine learning pipeline. We will be using scrapy to scrape content from webpages and use various python libraries to preprocess the data. By the end of the workshop, the attendees will create a news headlines dataset for sentiment analysis task and a Binary image classification dataset.

abstract: In this age of data-driven world, scraping and crawling content from the web to create datasets is a crucial skill to have in your portfolio. This workshop aims to give attendees a brief introduction into data scraping from web pages to cleaning the scraped data. By the end of the workshop, attendees should have acquired some hands-on experience with the topic by creating their very own datasets.<br/><br/>Attendees will learn about the entire data preparation and collection stage in a machine learning pipeline. We will be using scrapy (a python web-crawling framework) to scrape content from webpages and use various python libraries to preprocess the data. By the end of the workshop, the attendees will create a news headlines dataset (text data) for sentiment analysis task and a Binary image classification dataset (Paintings Vs Photographs).<br/><br/>
