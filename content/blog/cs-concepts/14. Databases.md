_Database_ refers to logical grouping of data that can support the electronic storage and manipulation of data from a computer system.

- Typically controlled by a **database management system (DBMS)**

Over past five decades, databases have evolved from flat file-based types to innovative relational and non-relational databases. Historically, databases have categorized into four groups:

1. Flat file-based
   - Consists of file systems with data maintained in files.
2. Heirarchical file-based database
   - Similar to a flat file-based system but the files share a parent-child relationship.
3. Relational databases
   - Manage data into tables
4. Non-relational databases
   - Customized databases

## A. Relational Databases

(aka) _relational database management system (RDMB)_, stores data in tables.

Tables use columns to hep define the information being stored and rows that hold actual data.

- Contains atleast column with unique values and that acts as the `primary key`
  - When a tableâ€™s primary key is used in a different table, the column in the second table is called a `foreign key`.

`SQL` - Structured query language is used to interact with relational databases. It is a standard language for relational database management systems and supports data retrival, query, and manipulation.

**Examples:**

1. MySQL
2. Oracle
3. Microsoft SQL Server
4. PostgreSQL
5. MariaDB

**Advantages**

1. Data accuracy - usage of primary and foreign keys help connect and identify databases
2. Simplified model
3. Easy access to data
4. Normalization

### I. When to use a relational database

- Preferred option for house data that contains a <u><b>fairly strong structure</b></u> with rows and columns
- Prime candidates - Include data points with a **consistent meaning** that can be placed into categories and that have relationships
- Better choice in scenarios in which <u><b>repeated data analysis</b></u> will result in a need to constantly query specific data cross sections.

## B. Non-relational Databases

Non-relational databases contain data stored in a non-tabular format and commonly use data structures such as documents or objects.

Two most common types of non-relational databases are:

1. Document-based
   - Stores data in documents
   - Supports variety of data types, such as strings, numbers, arrays, and objects
2. Key-value
   - Stores data in key-value pairs

**Examples:**

1. MongoDB
2. Amazon DynamoDB
3. Redis
4. Cassandra
5. ETCD
6. Google cloud Firestore

**Advantages**

1. Simple data management
2. Greater readability
3. Enhanced ability
4. Open-source options
5. High-performance
6. Better scalability

### I. When to use a non-relational database

- Suitable for use cases in which there is a large amount of data that relates to a single topic
  - Audience segments
  - Unified customer profiles
  - Industry-wide trend data
  - Application databases
  - Large collections of images, text or other data
- When data that is stored needs to be flixble in terms of size or shape
