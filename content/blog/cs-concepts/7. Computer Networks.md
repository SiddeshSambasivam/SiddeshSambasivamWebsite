## A. Transport layer services and protocols

The transport layer protocols provide the **logical communication** between applications/processes running in different hosts.

- These protocols run in the end systems and not in the network routers.
  - Sender: Breaks the application messages into **Segments**; passes it to network layers.
    - The segment is further encapsulated into network-layer packets called **Datagrams**.
      - The datagram is finally passed to the network router.
  - Receiver: Receives the segments and _re-assembles_ the application messages; passes it to application layer.

There are different transport layer protocols, each with its own characteristics. The following are the most common ones:

- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
- User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

### User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

"No frills," "bare bones" Internet transport protocol. UDP is a **connectionless** protocol.

**Connectionless:**

- No handshaking between UDP sender and receiver.
- Each segment is handled independently of others.

**Why use UDP?**

- No connection needs to be established which usually creates a delay
- Simple: no connection state at sender and receiver
- Small segment header
- No congestion control: USP can blast away as fast as desired

_Most often used for streaming multimedia applications._

Other uses: Domain name system (DNS), Simple network management protocol (SNMP)

Few notable ports and protocols:

| Port number     | Protocol     | Application              |
| --------------- | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| 53              | `UDP`, `TCP` | Domain name system (DNS) |
| 80              | `TCP`        | HTTP (WWW)               |
| 443             | `TCP`        | HTTPS (SSL)              |
| 16, 384-32, 767 | `UDP`        | Voice and video          |

### Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

"Connection-oriented" transport protocol.

**Properties:**

- Point-to-point: One sender, one receiver.
- Connection-oriented: Handshaking in it's sender. receiver state before data exchange.
- Full duplex: Bi-directional data flow in same connection
  - MSS: Maximum segment size
- Reliable, in-order byte stream: Segments are sent in order and acknowledged by receiver.
- Flow controlled: Segments are not sent if receiver is not ready.

**TCP Segment structure**

- Includes both source and destination port numbers, checksum.
- 32 bit sequence number, 32 bit acknowledgment number.
- 4 bit header length specifies the length of the TCP header in 32-bit words.
