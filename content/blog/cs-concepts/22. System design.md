## A. Introduction

The three stages to the interview:

- **Problem:** The interviewer gives you a purposely vague task.
- **Clarification:** You show leadership and experience by asking meaningful questions to clarify requirements and performance priorities.
- **Presentation:** You give an impromptu presentation on solutions (probably as youâ€™re thinking of the solution.)

## B. Methodology - Framework for System Design

1. Always start with **clarification**!

   - Ask about the priorities, scale and restrictions of the system

     - How many users?
     - How much data?
     - How many requests per second?
     - Latency requirements?

2. After understanding the requirements, start with a **high level solution**

   - Start abstract and simple to lay out an end to end solution
   - Draw an abstract diagram of the system
   - the components should be technology agnostic and abstract away scaling and concrete methods
   - eg: Checking whether the system prediction is real time, pre calculated batch or some hybrid

3. Start filling in some details; **architectural components**

   - eg: How models are delivered to the product? What type of infrastructure is required?

     - Decribe the reasoning behind the design choices

   - add data models if necessary

4. Start with **concerete component implementations**

   - Discuss the tradeoffs of the design choices
   - eg: Why did you choose a particular database? Why did you choose a particular language?

5. Finishing touches

## C. ML Model Development

1. Providing wide array of model types for the problem; it's good to cover some breadth instead of naming one solution.

2. Offline training and evaluation

   - Data used for training
     - How to deal with data imbalances?
   - Metrics used to compare models- Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC AUC, etc.
   - Evaluation methods
     - K-fold cross validation
     - Training sample selection

3. Online Evaluation

   - Evaluate the model performance via A/B testing
     - What metrics to use?

4. Model lifecycle management
   - Monitoring the model to ensure its health
   - Operations to track to keep model performance
     - How to manage the model lifecycle?
     - How to deal with model drift?
     - How to deal with model decay?

### I. ML Operational Diffculties

#### A. ML Drifts

{{< figure src="/leetcode/Diagram-1-min-1024x424.png" title="ML Drifts" >}}

1. Concept drift - The learned distribution changes over time due to behavioural changes
2. Data drift - The learned distribution changes over time due to changes in the data

#### What to do about it?

1. Setup data integrity and outlier monitoring
   - Data errors slowly degrade
   - Missing values
   - Broken data pipelines due to bugs or API updates
2. Setup model drift monitoring

## D. Elements of Distributed Systems

Distributed system is _an interconnected set of nodes that are linked by a network and share information between them._

### I. Microservices

A design paradigm where an application is structured to collect several independent services. The characteristics of these services include:

- Independent deployment
- Highly scalable
- Loosely coupled
- Highly maintainable and testable

### II. Service Discovery

A service discovery is a mechanism that allows services to find and communicate with each other without hardcoding the location of each other.

Eg: Apache zookeeper, consul, etcd

### III. Load Balancing

A device that acts as a **reverse proxy and distributes the network traffic** across several different servers. There are two distinct types of load balancers:

1. Layer 4
   - Act upon data found in network and transport layer protocols (IP, TCP, FTP, UDP)
2. Layer 7
   - Distributes requests based on application data (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP)

Standard algorithms for load balancing:

- Round Robin
- Least Connections
- Least Response Time
- Weighted Round Robin

### IV. Databases

Refer to the databases page for more details.

### V. Caches

A temporary storage with smaller capacity in memory with fast access time.

1. Client Caching
2. CDN Caching
3. Web Server Caching
4. Database Caching
5. Application Caching

### VI. File System Storage

A file is an unstructured collection of records. Two basic formats:

- Block storage - Organize data in blocks on disk
- Object storage
  - Amazon S3
  - Highlty scalable

### VII. Message Queues

Lets services to communicate with each other asynchronously. It is a **buffer** between the producer and consumer.

1. Producer - The service that produces the message and writes it to the queue
2. Consumer - The service that consumes the message from the queue and reads it from the queue

Example: RabbitMQ, Kafka
