## 1. Understand the problem

- What is the unknown? What are we trying to solve?
- What are the data, conditions, constraints?
- Draw a picture / diagram.
- Can we break the problem into sub-problems?

## 2. Devise a plan

- Have you seen a similar or related problem?
- Can we restate the problem in another way?
- Can we solve a part of the problem?
- Can we solve it by removing or changing some constraints?

## 3. Carry out the plan

- Check correctness of each step.
- did you use all the data?
- did you use all the conditions?
- did you apply all the constraints?

## 4. Look back

- can you check the result? does it look reasonable?
- can you derive the result differently?
