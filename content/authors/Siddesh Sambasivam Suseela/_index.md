I am siddesh, a senior at the _Nanyang Technological University (NTU)_. Currently, I am working on my final year project under [Prof. Mao Kezhi](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00158), co-supervised by [Dr. Yang Feng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=i-UD9l4AAAAJ&hl=en). My research is on the application of physics-informed neural networks in knowledge discovery, specifically, finding the governing equations of a system from its observational data.

Previously, I worked as a **Backend Engineer** at Shopee, Singapore. My work was focused on the developing an internal system for managing several deep learning models.
