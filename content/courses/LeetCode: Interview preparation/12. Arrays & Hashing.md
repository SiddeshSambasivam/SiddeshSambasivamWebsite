## A. General Introduction

{{% callout note %}}

Set is implemented as a hash table in python.

**Average case:** Lookup/insert/delete = O(1)

**Worst case:** Lookup/insert/delete = O(n); due to hash collision

### 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

Example:

> **Input:** nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2] \
> **Output:** 4
> **Explanation:** The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

#### Key ideas:

- What determines a sequence is the start and end, so create a set and check if the `num-1` exists in the set
  - If it does not exist, then it is the start of a sequence
    - iteratively increase the length of the sequence till the num is not in the set
    - check max length

```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

        if not nums:
            return 0

        history = set(nums)
        maxlen = float("-inf")

        for num in nums:

            if num-1 not in history:
                # start of a sequence
                length = 0
                while (num+length) in history:
                    length += 1

                maxlen = max(maxlen, length)

        return maxlen

```
