### 1. Endianness

The order or sequence in which the bytes of a data is stored in a computer memory. It is expressed as `big-endian (BE)` or `little-endian (LE)`.

1. `Big-endian`: The most significant byte (MSB) is stored at the smallest memory address.
2. `Little-endian`: The least significant byte (LSB) is stored at the smallest memory address.

### 2. Stack & Heap: Memory Allocation and management in python

When a variable is declared, for example `x=10` and `x=y` both have the same value memory, i.e both variable points to the same object. Python optimizes memory utilisation by allocating the same object reference to a new variable if object already exists in memory with same value.

Memory address stored by a variable can be found using `id()`.

The order of memory allocation in RAM is as follows (Low to high),

Heap is responsible to store all the values. A stack stores hold the references to the objects in the heap.

The name `heap` and `stack` does not have any relation to the data structure.

### 3. Processes and Threads

A **process** is a program that is currently under execution, whereas a **thread** is an execution entity that reside within a process that can be scheduled for execution. [^1]

A thread is an `execution unit` with its own stack and set of registers that reside in a <u>process</u>. A thread always belongs to exactly one process.

_Threads are also known as light-weight processes._

In a multi-threaded process, each thread has its own stack and registers but shares the same memory. This lets access to code segments, files and data be shared among threads.
