## A. General Introduction

#### I. What is it?

A powerful algorithmic mental model.

- Usually involves **iterable/sequential** data structures.
  - **contiguous** sequence of elements
  - strings, arrays, linked lists, etc.
- _Goal:_ Min, Max, Longest, Shortest, Contained
  - Calculating somthing: Average, sum, etc.

#### II. Lets meet the variants

1. Fixed length variant

   - max sum of subarray of size k

2. Dynamic variant

   - smallest sum that is greater than or equal to a target

3. Dynamic variant w/ Auxillary data structure (hashmap, set, etc.)
   - longest substring with at most k distinct characters
   - string permutation

_Commonalities:_

- Everything is grouped in a sequence

### 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

Example:

> **Input:** prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4] \
> **Output:** 5 \
> **Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5. \
> Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
