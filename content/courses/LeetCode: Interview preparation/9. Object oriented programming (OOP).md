### A. What is OOP?

Object oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of _classes_ and _objects_. The key idea is to structure the program into reusable pieces of code, which are used to create individual instances.

- _Class:_ An abstract blueprint used to create more specific, concrete objects.
  - They have shared attributes
  - classes can also contain functions called **methods**, available only to objects of that class
- _Object:_ An instance of a class.

### B. Why use OOP?

1. Models complex things as reproducible, simple structures.
2. Reusable.
3. Secure, protects information through encapsulation.

### C. Four principles of OOP

1. **Abstraction:** Exposing only high level public methods for accessing an object.
2. **Encapsulation:** Hiding implementation details from the user and exposing only selected information.
3. **Inheritance:** Child classes inherit data and behaviours from parent class.
4. **Polymorphism:** Designing objects to share behaviours. Polymorphism allows the same method to behave differently depending on the type of object.
   - _Method overriding:_ A child class can provide a different implementation than its parent class.
   - _Method overloading:_ Methods or functions can have same name, but different number and type of parameters.
