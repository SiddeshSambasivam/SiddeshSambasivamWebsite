{{< figure src="/marketb/tfs-1.jpg" width="300px" title="Image from https://kbimages1-a.akamaihd.net">}}

- Fast thinking - Unconsious, emotional, instictive.

  - Results in snap judgements and, sometimes, prejudices.

- Slow thinking - Considered as actual thoughts
  - Conscious; Deliverative, and mostly rational.

The process was mental work: deliberate, effortful, and orderlyâ€”a prototype of <u>slow thinking</u>.

### Two Systems

- **System 1 (S1)** operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control.

- **System 2 (S2)** allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. The operations of _System 2_ are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.

_System 1_ effortlessly creates impressions and feelings that are the main sources of explicit beliefs and deliberate choices of _System 2_.

- S1 generates suprisingly complex patterns of ideas; S2 construct thoughts in an orderly series of steps.

## Plot Synopsis

- S1 runs automatically and S2 is normally in a comfortable low-effor mode.
