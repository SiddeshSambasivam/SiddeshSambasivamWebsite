## 2. Perception

_What is perception?_ \
Our ability to comprehend and understand information that is presented to us.

- Perceptions are hard to change
- **Perception Inertia:** Tend to value the status-quo
- Hard to create positive perceptions for really new products

**Roadmap**

1. Why study perception?
2. How do we form perceptions?
3. Exercises

## 3. Why study perception?

- Helps in understanding what influences consumers' buying decisions
- Helps in understanding how a customer feels about a company or product.

- {{< hl >}} If customers perceive your business as having strong values that align with their own, they’re far more likely to purchase from you{{< /hl >}}

## 4. How do we form perceptions?

{{< figure src="/marketb/Perceptual-Process-4-1024x576.png" title="Image from https://kpu.pressbooks.pub/app/uploads/sites/9/2019/01/Perceptual-Process-4-1024x576.png">}}

**Stages of perception**

##### 1. Exposure

- **Absolute threshold:** We have selective stimuli, hence to be noticed, a stimulus has to be beyond the abdolute threshold.

  - _Stimulus:_ {{< hl >}}A thing or event that evokes a specific functional reaction in an organ or tissue.{{< /hl >}}; (_plural_ : stimuli)

- **Intrinsic vs. Extinsic cues**

  - Intrinsic cues are attributes, such as ingredients, that cannot be manipulated without also altering physical properties of the product

  - Extrinsic cues are product-related attributes-such as price, brand name, and packaging-which are not part of the physical product.

- **Cross-modal perception:** How the senses interact

###### Case study #1: Understanding change in logos

- <span style="color:red"><b>Gap</b></span>

  {{< figure src="marketb/The-Gap-Logo-Change.jpg" title="Image from https://www.thebrandingjournal.com/2021/04/learnings-gap-logo-redesign-fail/">}}

  - one online blog had generated 2,000 negative comments
  - “Make your own Gap logo” site went viral, collating almost 14,000 parody logo redesigns

- Starbucks

  - {{< hl >}}More rounded logos{{< /hl >}} were favored by people from {{< hl >}}interdependent, collectivist cultures{{< /hl >}}, including many countries in Asia, while {{< hl >}}angular logos{{< /hl >}} were more popular in {{< hl >}}individualistic cultures{{< /hl >}}, such as the U.S.

- Burger King
  - Refreshed look emulating an old logo used from 1969 to 1999

###### Case study #2: Tropicana packaging change

_Actions:_

- $35 Million spent on new advertising and packaging.

_Results:_

- 20% sales decline in 2 months
- double digit increase for competitors

##### 2. Attention

**Perceptual selection:** consumers select only a small portion of the stimuli. \
**Perceptual vigilance:** we are more likely to be aware of stimuli that relate to our current needs. \
**Perceptual defense:** if a stimulus threatens us in some way, we may not process it.

##### 3. Interpretation

{{< hl >}}Perception relies on existing schemas and scripts.{{< /hl >}}

###### Case study #3: Tropicana in India

- Had to be modified for the Indian market
- Taste did not correspond to the schema of “orange juice”
- **Schemas:** organized collections of beliefs and feelings that a person has about objects, ideas, people, of situations
  - _Schema_ associated with “juice” or “natural food”

## 5. Exercises

### 5.1. Exercise 1

- Group exercise

#### Perceptions and positioning

Marketers spend a lot of time trying to create positive perceptions for their product

- One approach is competition-based positioning: establishing a point of difference within a category

**Points of parity** is the similarity between your brand and the competition.
**Points of difference** is what sets you apart from
