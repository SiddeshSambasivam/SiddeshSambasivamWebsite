## A. Introduction

A research approach developed in the past 100 years to decipher the signs that are around us.

_Why do we study it in this course?_ Helps us understand how brands construct meaning.

## B. Signs

A sign acquires **meaning through its cultural context**: in relation to other signs in the text, through what is not present. It is defined by what it is not, as much as by what it is

- Signifier - A sign's physical form as distinct from its meaning
- Signified - The meaning of a sign

## C. Importance of Culture

Semiotic analysis looks for the meaningful cultural and psychological patterns – codes - that underlie language, art and other cultural expressions.

- Semiotics emphasizes on `shared culture` rather than individual psychology alone

There is no such thing as a single, "correct" interpretation of any text. There
are large numbers of possible interpretations, some of which will be more
likely than others in particular circumstances.

## D. Codes

A cluster of signs that together constitute a meaning. Codes help to simplify phenomena in order to make it easier to communicate experiences.

- Codes express the worldview of a particular culture at a given moment in its history.

Culture theorist Raymond Williams classifies codes into three categories:

- **Residual codes:** are the codes of the past - leftovers from an earlier set of cultural values and usages;

- **Dominant codes:** are the codes of the present - the current set of cultural values and usages;

- **Emergent codes:** are the codes of the future - the new set of cultural values and usages that are emerging.

## E. Binary Oppositions

Anthropologist `Levi-Strauss` insisted that relations among units in a structure (e.g.
a piece of communication) occur in binary pairs. Signs are defined as much by
what they are not, as what they are.

In fact the universe is described as **an almost infinite process of binary opposition**. This provides the model for our way of thinking.

Virtually every consistently successful brand today embodies its own particular myth. **Successful brands resolve contradictions by creating myths.** Levi-strauss words:

> "The purpose of a myth is to provide a logical model capable of overcoming a contradiction"

## F. Analyzing brand communications semiotically

1. Visual
2. Linguistic
3. Aural
4. Protagonists
5. Time
6. Non-verbal communication
7. Technique
8. Genre

## G. Identifying and ordering the codes

Example:

- IBM codes are more about professionalism and service
- Apple are about spontaneity and fun

Each brand’s communication will have its own set of residual, and dominant codes, and some might have emergent codes.
