### Personal Note

Being a EEE student, I did not get an opportunity to take DSA courses. However, this course gave an in-depth understanding of all the essential algorithms and data structures to write efficient programs. The lectures are enriched with detailed explanation of the concepts and the assignments complemented well with the lecture videos.
