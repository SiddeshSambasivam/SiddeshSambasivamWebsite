title: "Analysis of Algorithms"
date: "2021-05-09"
type: book
summary: The lecture discusses the scientific method to analyze the performance of algorithms. First, computational experiments were performed to measure the running times of test programs. Second, these measurements were used to develop hypotheses about performance. Third, mathematical models were introduced to explain their behavior. Finally, the memory usage of Java programs are analyzed.
