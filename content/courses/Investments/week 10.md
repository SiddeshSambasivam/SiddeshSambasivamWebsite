## A. Concept Checks

- What is yeild to maturity?

  - The discount rate that makes the PV of a bond's payments equal to its price.

  $$
  \text{Bond Value} = \Sigma^T_{t=1} \frac{\text{Coupon}}{(1+r)^t} + \frac{\text{Par Value}}{(1+r)^T}
  $$

- Bond prices and YTM are positively or inversely related?

  - **Inversely related**

- What are Premium and Discount bonds?

  - Bonds selling above/below par value
  - **Premium bonds** -- Bond prices are higher than par value
  - **Discount bonds** -- Bond prices are lower than par value

- Bond prices are less sensitive to interest rate if bond has shorter maturity and higher YTM
- An increase in a bondâ€™s YTM results in a smaller price change than a decrease in yield of equal magnitude

## B. Yield Curve

The relation between yields and time to maturity.

- Also called **term structure of interest rates.**

### 1. Expectations Hypothesis

Long term rates equal cumulative expected future short term rates.

Interest rate on a two-year bond:

$r_1$ = current interest rate on a one-year bond
$E(r_2)$ = Expected future short-term rate = One-year rate, one year from now

$$
(1+y_n)^n = (1+y_{n-1})^{n-1}(1+f_n)
$$

### 2. Liquidity Preference Theory

To hold longer-term bonds, investors may require a liquidity premium.

- _Why?_
  - Investors in general prefer short-term bonds, which have higher liquidity.
    - May need to sell bonds before maturity
  - Longer maturity bonds have higher interest rate risk
