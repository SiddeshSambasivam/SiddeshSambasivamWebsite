## A. Risk and Return: Past and Prologue

### I. Fundamentals Review

##### 1. Expectation

{{% callout note %}}
**Definition:** Arithmetic mean of a large number of independently selected outcomes of a random variable.
{{% /callout %}}

In the scope of investments, expectation is the investors' forecast of different states of the economy in the future.

- _Ex ante:_ Before the event.
  - Measures the expected return before the event.
- _Ex post:_ After the event.
  - Measures the expected return after the event.

| State of the economy | Probability | Return |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ------ |
| Recession            | 20%         | -5%    |
| Normal               | 50%         | 5%     |
| Expansion            | 30%         | 15%    |

$$\textbf{E(r)} = \Sigma_{s} \ p(s) \times [r_s]$$

_Variance_ is an important measure of uncertainty. Gives a quantitative measure of how much realized deviates from what expected.

$$\sigma^2 = \Sigma_{s} \ p(s) \times [r_s - \text{E(r)}]^2$$

##### 2. Ex-post average returns & $\sigma$

**Ex-post:** After the fact, at t (today):

- Use the past to predict the future.
- Empirically, we use ex post (history) average returns to approximate ex ante expected returns.

{{< hl >}}**Holding period return (HPR):** Total return on an asset or investment portfolio over the period for which the asset or portfolio has been held.{{< /hl >}}

$$\bar{r} = \Sigma^T_{t=1}\frac{\text{HPR}_t}{T}$$

Where, $T$ is number of observations and $\bar{r}$ is the average HPR.

Expost variance:
$$\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{T-1} \Sigma_{i=1}^T (r_i-\bar{r})^2$$

Expost standard deviation:
$$\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}$$

{{% callout note %}}
$\sigma$ = standard deviation as a risk measure.
{{% /callout %}}

**Annualizing the statistics:**

$$\bar{r}_{\text{annual}} = \bar{r}_p \times \text{periods} $$

$$\sigma_{annual} = \sigma_{period} \times \sqrt{\text{\# periods}}$$

##### 3. Normal distribution

In finance, we use the normal distribution to approximate the possible outcomes investors face.

- Risk is the difference between the expected return and the realized (actual) returns.

{{< figure src="investments/normal-distribution.png" title="Image from https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/normal-distribution/">}}

Normal distributions have key characteristics that are easy to spot in graphs:

1. The `mean`, `median` and `mode` are exactly the same.
2. The distribution is symmetric about the meanâ€”half the values fall below the mean and half above the mean.
3. The distribution can be described by two values: the _mean_ and the _standard deviation_.

{{% callout note %}}
The **mean** is the **location parameter** while the **standard deviation** is the **scale parameter**.
{{% /callout %}}

**Empirical rule**

The empirical rule, or the 68-95-99.7 rule, tells you where most of your values lie in a normal distribution:

- Around 68% of values are within 1 standard deviation from the mean.
- Around 95% of values are within 2 standard deviations from the mean.
- Around 99.7% of values are within 3 standard deviations from the mean.

_Value at Risk (VaR):_ The value at risk is the expected shortfall for a given confidence level.

- $E+(x)\sigma$ are the best cases
- $E-(x)\sigma$ are the worst cases

Hence, the attractiveness of an investment depends not just on the expected returns, but also the risk of losses.

### II. Arithmetic vs. Geometric

When evaluating performance, the geometric average is more precise in describing performance when volatility is high.

When **statistically** calculating _expected returns_ using historical data, use simple average (Arithmetic) often because it is convenient, and it has nice statistical properties.

- {{< hl >}}Large sample theory:{{< /hl >}} Sample size n grows indefinitely.
- {{< hl >}}Law of large numbers{{< /hl >}} tells that the sample mean of a random variable converges to its true mean for a large sample.

### III. Ex-ante Risk Premium & Risk Aversion

- **Risk premium**: The difference in expected return between risky and risk-free investments.

  - How much I would like to have at stake to be able to get high returns

  - Why do invester require it?

    - Investors are risk averse hence require a compensation to take on risk.

  * (aka) average excess return

- **Risk-free rate $(r_f)$**: Rate of return that can be earned with certainty.

## B. Inflation and Real Rates of Return

Taxes are paid on nominal investment income. This reduces real investment income even further.

- nominal rate of return is amount of money generated by an investment before factoring in expenses such as taxes and inflation.

$$r_{\text{real}} \approx [r_{\text{nominal}}\times (1-\text{tax \%})] - \text{Inflation rate}$$

## C. Asset Allocation Across Risky and Risk-Free Portfolios

_How much of your wealth should you invest in risky assets?_

The amount you invest would depend on:

1. Risk
2. Risk premium - how much do investors get compensated for risk
3. Risk aversion - How much do investors dislike risk?

### I. Complete Portfolio

The entire portfolio including risky portfolio (RP) and risk-free portfolio (RF).

$$E(r_{\text{complete}}) = yE(r_p) + (1-y)r_f$$

Risk-free asset, $r_f$: proxy with T-Bills/money market instruments.

$y$ is called the _weight in the risky portfolio_.

$$\sigma^2_{\text{complete}}=(y\sigma_{rp})^2 + [(1-y)\sigma_{\text{rf}}]^2$$

{{< hl >}}$\sigma_{\text{rf}}=0$ as the return from a risk-free asset is certain.{{< /hl >}}

### III. Capital Allocation Line (CAL)

{{< figure src="/investments/cal.png" title="Image from the lecture slide" width="600px">}}

$$E(r_c) = r_f + y\times(E(r_p)-r_f)$$

The slope of the CAL measures the **trade-off** between risk ($\sigma_p$) and **risk premium** ($E[r_p]-r_f$).

The slope is known as the **Sharpe ratio.**

#### 1. Using Leverage with CAL

Borrow at the risk-free rate and invest in risky portfolio.
With 50% leverage: $y=1.5$

Own money = $10,000

Borrowed money = $5,000

$$y=\frac{\text{own money}+\text{borrowed money}}{\text{own money}}$$

{{< figure src="/investments/cap-lev.png" width="600px" title="Image from the lecture slide">}}

### IV. Risk Aversion and Allocation

_Risk aversion_ is the willingness to trade off risk against
expected return.

- Individual investors have different levels of risk aversion.

### V. Quantifying Risk Aversion

Mean-variance analysis is one part of <u>modern portfolio theory</u>.

**Assumption:** Investors seek low risk and high reward.

- Variance may tell how spread out the returns of a specific security are on a daily or weekly basis.
- Expected return is a probability expressing the estimated return of the investment in the security.

$$A = \frac{E(r_c)-r_f}{\sigma_c^2}\gt0 \ \text{if risk adverse}$$

- Large A means that investor require additional return to bear risk

Average risk aversion = 1.5 to 4 (Empericallly)

A = 0; Risk neutral
A < 0; Risk loving

$$y_{\text{percent in risky asset}} = \frac{(E(r_p)-r_f)/\sigma_p^2}{A_i}$$

## D. Efficient Diversification

### I. Asset Allocation With Two Risky Assets

#### 1. Expected Return: Two Risky Assets

$$E(r_p) = W_1E_1(r_1)+W_2E(r_2)$$

#### 2. Portfolio Variance and Standard Deviation: Two Risky Assets

$$\sigma^2_p = W_1^2\sigma^2_1 + W_2^2\sigma^2_2 + 2W_1W_2\text{Cov}(r_1,r_2)$$

$$Cov(R_A, R_B) = \frac{\Sigma_i^n(R_{A_i}-\bar{R_{A}})\times(R_{B_i}-\bar{R_{B}})}{n-1}$$

#### 3. Relation between Covariance & Correlation Coefficient

- Correlation coefficient $\rho$

$$\rho_{1,2} = \frac{\text{Cov(r_1, r_2)}}{\sigma_1 \times \sigma_2}$$

- Correlation measures the intensity and direction that two stocks tend to move together

- Correlation is standardized to be between 1 and -1

#### 4. Correlation Coefficient ($\rho_{1,2}$)

- If $\rho_{1,2}=1.0$ - Perfectly positively correlated

  - $\sigma(1,2) = W_1\sigma_1 + W_2\sigma_2$

Correlation is standardized to be between -1 and +1.

- If $\rho_{1,2}=-1.0$ - Perfectly negatively correlated
  - $\sigma(1,2) = \pm(W_1\sigma_1 - W_2\sigma_2$)

$$\sigma^2_p = W_1^2\sigma^2_1 + W_2^2\sigma^2_2 + 2W_1W_2\text{Cov}(r_1,r_2)$$

$$\text{Cov}(r_1, r_2)=\rho_{1,2}\sigma_1 \sigma_2$$

$$\sigma^2_p = W_1^2\sigma^2_1 + W_2^2\sigma^2_2 + 2W_1W_2\rho_{1,2}\sigma_1 \sigma_2$$
