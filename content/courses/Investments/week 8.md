## A. Implications of EMH

Two broad approaches to stock analysis:

1. Technical analysis

   - Future prices follow a trend
   - Finding patterns in historical prices
   - Assumes **weak** form of EMH is violated

2. Fundamental analysis
   - Assumes **semi-strong** form of EMH is violated
   - Forecast future earnings

### 1. Technical Analysis

| Focus  | Quantitative & qualitative factors | Price & volume     |
| Data   | Financial statements               | Charts             |
| Time   | Long term                          | Short-term         |
| Goal   | Investing                          | Trading            |

### 2. Active and Passive Management

**Active management** -- Identifying the "mispriced" securities to beat the market

- Assumes the efficient market hypothesis is false

**Passive management** -- Invest in a well-diversified portfolio without searching for security mispricing.

- Assumes Semi-strong form efficiency

## B. Testing Market Efficiency

**Event studies** -- Examine how quickly information integrates into prices around an informational event

- EMH suggests rapid integration of information into prices.

**Testing a trading rule** -- Based on past trading information to attempt to earn abnormal returns

- EMH suggests that such rules will not work
