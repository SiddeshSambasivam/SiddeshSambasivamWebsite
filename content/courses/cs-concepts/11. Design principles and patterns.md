## A. SOLID principles

A mnemonic for 5 design principles of object-oriented programs.

{{< figure src="/leetcode/solid.png" title="Image from freeCodeCamp">}}

1. **Single responsibility principle (SRP):** A class, module, or function in a program should do only one job.

   - If a single functionality breaks, you know where the bug will be in the code and can trust that only that class will break.

2. **Open-closed principle (OCP):** A program should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

   - create entities that can be widely adapted but also remain unchanged.
     - creating duplicate entities with specialized behavior through polymorphism.

3. **Liskov substitution principle (LSP):** Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.

   - In simpler words, any class must be directly replaceable by any of its subclasses without error.

4. **Interface segregation principle (ISP):** Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

   > Any unused part of the method should be removed or split into a separate method.

5. **Dependency inversion principle (DIP):** One should depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions.

   - High level modules should not depend upon low level modules. Both should depend upon abstractions.
   - Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
     > If you minimize dependencies, changes will be more localized and require less work to find all affected components.

   * DIP decouples high and low-level components and instead connects both to abstractions.

### A1. Achieve Low Coupling

1. Avoid deep inheritance

   - Seperate creating resources from using them

2. Introduce abstractions

   - Use interfaces and abstract classes

3. Avoid inappropriately intimacy

   - What is it? Getting a lot more data than the required data.

4. Introduce an intermediate data structure
