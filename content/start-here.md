Hey! I am Siddesh and this website is my <i>digital commonplace book</i>, a place which holds all my <a href="/#projects">projects</a>, thoughts and learnings.

Currently, I work as a <i>Software Engineer</i> at <a href="https://www.hypotenuse.ai/" target="_blank">Hypotenuse AI</a>. I build scalable and reliable LLM systems that help businesses manage and create their marketing content.

Previously, I interned as Backend Engineer at Shopee, Singapore. To know more, take a look at my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/siddeshss/details/experience/" target="_blank">past experiences and learnings</a>. I graduated from Nanyang Technological University with a _Bachelor’s in Electrical and Electronic Engineering_ and a _second major in Business._ And completed my final year thesis, <a href="#">“Scientific Machine Learning for Knowledge Discovery”</a>, under Prof. Mao Kezhi, co-supervised by Dr. Feng Yang.
